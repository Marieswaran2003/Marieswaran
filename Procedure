Step by Step Procedure:

Step 1: Circuit Connections

a. Connect the Ultrasonic sensor, LDR, to the Arduino board. Make sure to connect power (VCC and GND) and signal (Trig, Echo for Ultrasonic sensor; Analog pin for LDR;).
b. Connect the LED and DC motor to the relay module. Connect the relay module to the Arduino for control.
c. Power the DC motor with an external power source, and ensure the grounds of the Arduino and motor power supply are common.

Step 2: Write the Arduino Code

You'll need to write an Arduino sketch to control the entire system. This code should include the following functionality:
a. Ultrasonic Sensor: Measure distances in front of the vehicle. If an obstacle is detected too close, activate the anti-collision system.
b. LDR: Monitor ambient light levels. When it gets dark (low LDR reading), turn on the LED headlamp automatically.
c. Relay Module: Control the LED (headlamp) and DC motor (anti-collision system) based on inputs from the Ultrasonic sensor and LDR.

Step 3: Assemble and Test

a. Assemble the components and circuits in a suitable enclosure.
b. Upload your Arduino code to the Arduino board.
c. Test the system to ensure that it functions as expected. Verify that the headlamp turns on/off based on light levels, the anti-collision system activates when an obstacle is detected.

Step 4: Fine-Tuning and Calibration
Calibrate the system to ensure that it responds appropriately to various lighting and collision scenarios. Adjust sensor thresholds and timing as needed.

Step 5: Safety and Compliance
Ensure that your project adheres to safety regulations and compliances. Make sure it does not pose a hazard while in use in a vehicle.

Step 6: Deployment
Mount the system in your vehicle and periodically test it to make sure it functions correctly.
